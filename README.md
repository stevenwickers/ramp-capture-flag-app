# This is a code test of Capture the Flag for Ramp

## I have never done capture the flag test before and loved it! 

I never did a capture the flag exercise before, so I did it the hard by 
opening the HTML and searching for all occurrences of class="ramp ref"
to build the URL. I know this was incorrect, but I will explore
more efficient ways to accomplish this task.
